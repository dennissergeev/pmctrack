### Parameters for vorticity smoothing
# Type of smoothing. 0: no smoothing 1: average in a rectangular 2: average in a circle
smth_type=2
# Number of x-grid for smoothing the vorticity (when smth_type is 1)
n_smth_x=4
# Number of y-grid for smoothing the vorticity (when smth_type is 1)
n_smth_y=4
# Radius for smoothing the vorticity with uniform filter (km) (when smth_type is 2)
r_smth=60.0
#
#
### Parameters for vortex detection
# Vorticity threshold for vortex peak
zeta_max0=1.5e-4
# Vorticity threshold for vortex area
zeta_min0=1.2e-4
# The interval for increasing zeta_min - technical
int_zeta_min0=0.02e-4
# Scale factor to split vortex if del_zeta > gamma * zeta_max,
# where zeta_max is vorticity of secondary peak,
# and del_zeta the difference between zeta_max and the vorticity of the saddle point between the peaks.
# Low gamma leads to many splits. If smoothing in a large area is applied gamma can be small.
gamma=0.1
#
### Parameters for calculating steering winds
# Type of steering. 1: average in a rectangular 2: average in a circle
steering_type=2
# Number of x-grid boxes (when steering_type is 1)
n_steering_x=20
# Number of x-grid boxes (when steering_type is 1)
n_steering_y=20
# Radius for steering wind (km) (when steering_type is 2)
r_steering=200.0
#
### Parameters for linking vortex
# Type of tracking. 1: linking in a rectangular 2: linking in a circle
track_type=2
# Longitude difference of box for linking vortices (deg), after calculation of steering position (when track_type is 1)
lon_link=1.0
# Latitude difference of box for linking vortices (deg), after calculation of steering position (when track_type is 1)
lat_link=0.8
# Radius for linking vortices (km), after calculation of steering position (when track_type is 2)
r_link=100.0
# Option to merge vortex by isolated vortex area within linking radius (second option in Watanabe (0: no, 1: yes)
merge_opt_vort_area=0
# What parameter is used to define a dominant vortex when two vortices are merged together: merge_opt=1 is by distance (as in Watanabe's original code), merge_opt=2 is by vortex size
merge_opt=1
#
### Parameters for labelling the synoptic scale disturbances (ECs and CFs)
## Extra-tropical cyclones (ECs) are labelled if condition 1 and 2 are satisfied:
# Radius within which the SLP minima is detected (km)
r_ec=300
# Condition 1: Strength of the SLP minima compared with the largest closed contour of SLP that encloses the minimum (hPa) has to exceed:
del_psea_min=0.5
# Condition 2: Within distance_ec is a vortex area (km) larger than:
area_ec=40000
#
## Cold front (CF) are labelled if
# Length of cold front = distance between southern and northern edge of the vortex (km) exceeds
length_cf=500.0
# additionally the bearing angle of the front axis (line from the southern to the northern edge of the vortex) and the north must be between -20 and 60 deg
theta_cf_min=20 #this is the negative value of the number
theta_cf_max=60 #must be a positive number
# and the average curvature along the ridge of the front (defined by local maxima in vorticity within local neighborhood of 1 grid cell) must not exceed "curv_cf" by using quadratical fitting:
curv_cf=0.1
# where R**2, the coefficient of determination of the fit, must exceed:
det_coeff_cf=0.8
#
### OUTPUT
# Save intermediate data in .dat binary files (0=no, 1=yes)
